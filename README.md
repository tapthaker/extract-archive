## Extract Archive

Extract-archive is a utility that extracts static archive files Ref: [FreeBSD Manual Pages ar](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ar).

### Why?

The ar utility that macOS ships with does not work when multiple object-files with the same name are present in the archive. This utility aims to handle extraction in such situations.
